            <p>I know, I know, WHO IS RICHARD!?! Well for starters, I like sunsets and long walks on the beach.
            I used to be a plumber and am looking to get into software development. I have a wife and two beautiful children.
            I am quite tall, coming in at 6'10". I have limited knowledge in Java, and am very excited to begin my journey in
            software development.
